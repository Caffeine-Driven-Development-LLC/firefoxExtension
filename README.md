Its purpose is to help users who are looking for a new job.

It will accomplish this by providing more data to users about job posts they come across while browsing the web.

More specifically, It will display a small graphic on links to job posts that will show if the user has seen the link
before, and when they first saw the link, or if the link is new to the user.
Ideal this should help users identify openings they have already viewed, and identify roles they have not yet looked at.

Users will also be given the option to bookmark links to openings, so they may easily navigate to them at a later point.

Future state of this extension should talk with the App Track application if it is installed and running on the users
machine to provide even more information

- If a users has already applied to a role, and what state the application is in.

## TODO

- Bring in some unit tests, come on Ian you should know this by now.
- Build a pipeline for the ML algo to get into this app
